# How to Use the Script
To check if your site have setup the Bing pixel correct with Consent Mode, follow the steps below:

- Download the script from this repository [here](paste-this-script-in-console)
- Open your website in a web browser.
- Accept any cookies.
- Open the browserâ€™s Developer Console. On most browsers, you can do this by right-clicking the page and selecting Inspect or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).
- In the Console tab, paste the script you downloaded from the repository.
- Hit Enter.

The script will run and check if a Bing tag is loaded onto the site, and if Consent is set to Approved.
If not, you need to audit your setup, since conversions may not be tracked properly.
